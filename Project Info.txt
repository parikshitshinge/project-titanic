This Data Analysis project is using Titanic dataset.

The dataset is from Kaggle Competition and is present on: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

The analysis project answers some questions on the data set, such as:

Basic Questions:
1. Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages, Gender, Class etc.)
2. What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3. Where did the passengers come from?
4. Who was alone and who was with family?

Broader question:
5. What factors helped someone survive the sinking? 
6. Did the deck have an effect on the passengers survival rate? Did this answer match up with your intuition?
7. Did having a family increase the odds of survival the crash?
